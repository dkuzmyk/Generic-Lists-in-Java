# Generic-Lists-in-Java
In this project you will implement your own versions of the stack and queue data structures. Although the Java API provides built-in support for them, you will write your own to practice the constructs and language details we have seen in class. That means you are NOT allowed to use any pre existing libraries or classes for this assignment. In this simplified version, each data structure is a singly linked list. The stack is LIFO (last in first out) while the queue is FIFO (first in first out). Your implementation must be generic as to allow for different types when each data structure object is instantiated. You will also implement the Iterator design pattern; allowing users access to a custom Iterator for your data structures.
